Unordered:

· The closure abuse in Serv precludes using the URL to generate the routes.
  This needs a fix in order to generalize beyond Pleroma.
· Stats and webvac-unsweep.  This will allow hot objects to be swapped out of
  venti.
· Implement the venti protocol instead of calling $plan9bin/vac.
· Pool venti servers.
· Redis does a fine job for the lookup tables, but I cannot shake the feeling
  that I should be using something else.  Maybe I'm just overly nervous about
  it.
· Etags?
