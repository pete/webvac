This is a somewhat specialized chunk of code!

THIS IS ALSO BETA SOFTWARE.  CAVEAT EMPTOR.

Using a lookup table in Redis and venti as the backing storage, webvac
serves static content.  It comes with utilities "webvac-sweep" and
"webvac-unsweep" that push things into venti and remove them from the
filesystem and place the things back into the filesystem, respectively.
The 'webvac' program itself starts up a webserver.  Give these programs
'-h' or '--help' to see helpful(?) information, and see below for
configuration.

Currently I am only using it to serve uploads for UGC in Pleroma.  I
have been using venti to do incremental backups of the data, and since
the uploads are WORM ("write once, read many") data, I thought it'd be
cool to serve the data directly out of venti.

I expect to use this more often and thus expect it to become a bit more
general as a result.

= Quick Start

  [Check that your venti and Redis servers are operational.]
  $ sudo ed /etc/webvac.json
  a
  '{"server_path_prepend":"/where/uploads/get/put/in/the/filesystem"}'
  .
  wq
  $ sudo $EDITOR /etc/nginx/whatever
  [edit your nginx configuration to proxy requests for files to localhost:8891
  if the file doesn't exist]
  $ webvac-server -D
  $ find /where/uploads/get/put/in/the/filesystem -type f -print0 |
   xargs -0 -n30 -P8 webvac-sweep -v -- 
  [At this point, you should be able to rm the files in server_path_prepend
  to start serving them out of venti.  Big ones are slow for now.]

= Mise en place

You will need a venti server and a Redis server.  It'll work fine with
either Plan 9 venti or P9P venti.  You will also need the 'vac' and
'unvac' utilities that come with P9P.

You will need to either have all the stuff in the default places, or
you'll need to configure a handful of things.  Otherwise, you will need
to configure probably one thing.

= Overhead

For about 100GB of files, venti takes 86GB of disk (no surprise, since
it's mostly JPGs and MP4s, so it's already compressed; the savings are
probably from dedup), and Redis takes about 60MB of RAM for this.  All
of the files were put into venti as part of the backup solution, but the
originals weren't removed if they were bigger than 4MB (see doc/TODO).
The workers take some RAM to run.  CPU overhead is negligible.

= Installation

`gem install webvac` should do it.

= Configuration

The nginx config I used to test is in doc/examples.

You will need to create a JSON file that specifies the configuration.
The first readable file from the following list is used:

* The filename given in the $WEBVAC_CONFIG environment variable.
* ./config/webvac.json
* $HOME/.webvac.json
* /etc/webvac.json

Here is an annotated list of configuration options, all of which start
with their default values.  You will almost certainly need to change
server_path_prepend.

  {
    // A Redis connection string, one that Redic will take:
    "redis_url": "redis://localhost:6379/0",

    // These two options are used to turn the request path into a filesystem
    // path.  Watch this space, I might turn server_path_strip into an array.

    // The beginning of the path that the entire server sits under; that is,
    // what should be stripped from the front of the path.  For Pleroma, users'
    // uploads are all under /media, so this works if you're serving uploads from
    // https://$domain/media/$file .  You should probably not change this one for
    // now, as Rake routes depend on it.
    "server_path_strip": "/media",
    // The beginning of the path in the *filesystem* that corresponds to where
    // the files are kept.  It is *incredibly* unlikely that you are using the
    // same path I am.
    "server_path_prepend": "/media/block/fse",

    // This is where the venti server is.  (This might be an array at some
    // point.)  This address is in dial(2) syntax, by the way, so $host:$port
    // should be written "tcp!$host!$port".  
    "venti_server": "localhost",

    // Where the vac and unvac binaries are kept:
    "plan9bin": "/opt/plan9/bin",

    // This is to make UGC work safely out of the box.  Hopefully no browser is
    // dumb enough to run stuff inside <script> tags in something we're serving
    // as text/plain:
    "mime_substitutions": {
      "text/html": "text/plain"
    }
  }

= Usage

Afer configuring, you can run the server with `webvac-server`.  This will actually serve the content from venti, as long as it is present in the pathâ†’score index in Redis (so you can remove content as needed by just removing items from the index).  In order to add items, you run `webvac-sweep`.
